# ThreatHuntin
Currently interning/learning to become a threat hunter. This will house most of my resources for learning threat hunting as well as some scripts I might create from time to time. Eventually I would like to create a blog with more collected thoughts on how I learned threat hunting and how some other team leaders can go about teaching/training people about threat hunting but in the meantime this is all I got.
