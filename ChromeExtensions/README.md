#README 
I recently did a threat hunt for my internship regarding chrome extensions in our environment.

The Goal for this repo is to contain some notes from my hunt and the script that I created to use for this hunt.

These notes won't contain anything too specific but will have general notes for anybody trying to conduct a similar hunt in their environment and have some form of guidance.
