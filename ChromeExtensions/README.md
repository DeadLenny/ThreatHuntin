# README
I recently did a threat hunt for my internship regarding chrome extensions in our environment.

The Goal for this repo is to contain some notes and resources that I used for the hunt.

These notes won't contain anything too specific but will have general notes for anybody trying to conduct a similar hunt in their environment and have some form of guidance.
